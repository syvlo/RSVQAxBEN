# Introduction

This code presents the database construction of the RSVQAxBEN dataset, and the model both presented in [1]. This database leverages BigEarthNet, a large-scale dataset on landcover classification presented in [2]. Please cite [1] if you use this code.

# How to use

The code is mainly organized in two jupyter notebooks:
* BigEarthNetVQA.ipynb presents the database construction procedure and allow you to modify the database if needed;
* Model.ipynb presents the model training procedure (including dataloader).
